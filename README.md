# ProvuLinux "Try Linux!"

![Minimal Linux Script](http://minimal.idzona.com/mls/minimal_linux_script.png)

The script below is a small utility for creating a live environment of Linux, primarily testing new Kernels, Userland, Programs, etc. There's no practical use to this utiliy unless you're a developer of Linux or BusyBox as this is all it builds but I like testing Linux Kernels out with different functionaity and boot times so. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Support is only limited to Ubuntu 16.04+ **FOR NOW** so the following dependencies **HAVE** to be installed.
    sudo apt-get install wget bc build-essential gawk xorriso 
    
Once they're installed, run the script below via normal means of execution or typing `./provulinux` in the command line where the file is installed.

The script is basically Minimal Live Script but with a bunch of knifty buttons attached with compact and extra functionality, so thanks for a solid base @Ivandavidov !
